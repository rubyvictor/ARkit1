This practice project using ARKit has been created on Swift 9 Beta and attempts to render a 3D model of a sunglasses onto a scene using the iOS device's camera.  However, I do not yet have a secondary iOS device to download iOS 11 so it has not yet been tested.  Please do not hesitate to test it and feedback if it works :)  cheers
